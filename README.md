#Description
"When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground." - Cersei

Welcome! Here we have a "Game of Thrones" trivia game but dont be fooled this isn't any ordinary trivia game.  The basis of the game is to pick a wager and answer the many questions through CLI prompt correctly potentially doubling your wager.  For each question you are required to set a wager that ranges differently depending to the depth of your pocket and/or your GoT nerdiness! For correct answers you get to keep your gold dragon coins and earn your wagered amount. For incorrect answers your gold dragon coin wager is removed from your possession. The questions might have a similar basis but will be different every time around.  At the end of the game you will get to record your score to see if you won or you died!
